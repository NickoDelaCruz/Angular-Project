<!-- # Hollywood Video resurrection

Revamping a dead company's website, allowing users to view and purchase DVDs.

Since hollywood video doesn't have a site anymore, i'm going by memory, or until I find a cached ver.

However
http://www.blockbuster.com/ is still active so I will lean towards that design as a last resort.
